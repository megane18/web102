# Web Development Project 6 - Brewery Explorer

Submitted by: Megane Alexis

This web app: Brewery Explorer, is a React-based interface that allows users to discover and explore breweries across the United States. It fetches data from the Open Brewery API, displaying a grid of breweries with filtering options for state, type, and search terms. Users can view brewery details such as name, location, type, and contact information, with links to brewery websites if available. The interface is styled with modern, gradient backgrounds and animated transitions, offering a sleek, responsive design that highlights search results and allows pagination for loading more breweries.
